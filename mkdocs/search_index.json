These connected devices do not have an IP address.\n\n\n\n\ndial-peer voice \nnumber-tag\n pots\n destination-pattern \nprefix or full telephone number\n\n port 0/0/0\n exit\n\n\n\n\nVerifying dial-peers:\n\n\nshow dial-peer voice\nshow dial-peer voice summary\n\n\n\n\nDebugging dial-peers:\n\n\ndebug voip dialpeer\n\n\n\n\nConfiguring a POTS Dial Peer for a T1 interface\n\n\ndial-peer voice 2000 pots\n destination-pattern 2...\n no digit-strip\n port 1/0:23\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWith POTS dial peers, the router automatically strips any explicitly defined digits before forwarding the call. E.g. 9....... =\n 9 is stripped before forwarding the remaining digits to the PSTN.\n\n\nVoIP dial peers do not automatically strip digits.\n\n\n\n\nDealing with automatic digit-stripping of POTS dial peers\n\n\nExample of configuration of a North American PSTN dial plan on a router, where the T1 CAS voice port 1/0:1 is connected to the PSTN, and internal users must dial 9 for outside PSTN access.\n\n\ndial-peer voice 90 pots\n description Service dialing\n destination-pattern 9[469]11\n forward-digits 3\n port 1/0:1\n exit\n\ndial-peer voice 91 pots\n description 10-digit dialing\n destination-pattern 9[2-9]..[2..9]......\n port 1/0:1\n exit\n\ndial-peer voice 92 pots\n description 11-digit dialing\n destination-pattern 91[2-9]..[2-9]......\n forward-digits 11\n port 1/0:1\n exit\n\ndial-peer voice 93 pots\n description International dialing\n destination-pattern 9011T\n prefix 011\n port 1/0:1\n exit\n\n\n\n\n\n\nforward-digits \nnumber\n specifies number of right-justified digits to forward.\n\n\nprefix \nnumber\n adds specified digits before forwarding.\n\n\n\n\nConfiguring VoIP Dial Peers\n\n\nExample:\n\n\ndial-peer voice 2000 voip\n destination-pattern 2...\n session target ipv4:\nip address of next-hop\n\n codec g711ulaw         ! Optional; default is G.729\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote that calls will fail if there is a \ncodec mismatch\n - when codec values do not match between two routers.\n\n\n\n\nUsing Dial Peer Wildcards\n\n\n.   Period      Matches any dialed digit or the * key on telephone keypad\n+   Plus        Matches one or more instances of the preceding digit\n[]  Brackets    Matches a range of digits; ^ before a digit designates \ndo not match\n\nT   Any         Matches any number of dialed digits (from 0-32)\n,   Comma       Inserts a 1-second pause between dialed digits.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo match a destination pattern of any using T, the destination should be created as \n.T\n,\n\n\n\n\nSee P.134 Table 6-4 and 6-5 for example bracket wildcards / PSTN destination patterns for North America.\n\n\nPrivate Line Automatic Ringdown (PLAR)\n\n\n\n\nPLAR configurations rely heavily on existing dial peers to complete a call.\n\n\nPorts configured with PLAR capabilities automatically dial a number as soon as the port detects an off-hook signal.\n\n\nConfiguring PLAR connections are useful for \nincoming calls for analog FXO trunks\n\n\n\n\nExample to hard-code FXS voice port 0/0/0 to dial 1102 when the user lifts the handset:\n\n\nvoice-port 0/0/0\n connection plar 1102\n\n connection plar opx 1101\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWith \nplar opx\n, voice port does not answer until the remote side has answered. If you are transferring to an extension over which you have no control (an off premise extension), it's beneficial for the port to wait to answer the call until it knows the far end is going to answer. This keeps the gateway from answering a call and then having nowhere to route it. (\nSource\n)\n\n\n\n\nUnderstanding Router Call Processing and Digit Manipulation\n\n\nTwo primary rules:\n\n\n\n\nThe most specific destination pattern always wins.\n\n\nWhen a match is found, the router immediately processes the call.\n\n\n\n\nTo test which dial peer will match a specific string:\n\n\nshow dialplan number \nnumber to test\n\n\n\n\n\nMatching Inbound and Outbound Dial Peers\n\n\nWhen a router receives a voice call, it must always match a dial peer in some way for the router to process the call.\n\n\nA router matches inbound dial peers through the following five methods:\n\n\n\n\nMatch the dialed number (DNIS) using the \nincoming called-number\n dial-peer config.\n\n\nMatch the caller ID info (ANI) using the \nanswer-address\n dial-peer config.\n\n\nMatch the caller ID info (ANI) using the \ndestination-pattern\n dial-peer config.\n\n\nMatch an incoming POTS dial peer using the \nport dial-peer configuration\n command.\n\n\nIf no match has been found using the previous four methods, use \ndial peer 0\n.\n\n\n\n\nDial peer 0\n is like a default gateway dial peer that appears when there is no dial peer match (only for inbound dial peers, not for outbound dial peers).\n\n\nFailover Implementation\n\n\nUsing the \npreference\n command allows the router to determine which dial peer to use when destination patterns are identical.\n\n\ndial-peer voice 10 voip\n destination-pattern 6...\n ! ...\n preference 0\n exit\ndial-peer voice 11 pots\n destination-pattern 6...\n ! ...\n preference 1\n exit\n\n\n\n\nTransforming Dialed Numbers\n\n\nUsing \nnum-exp\n global configuration command universally transforms the dialed number 0 (anywhere in an organization) to 5000, then would search for a dial peer allowing it to reach 5000.\n\n\nvoice-port 1/0/1\n connection plar 0\n exit\nnum-exp 0 5000\n\n\n\n\nSpecific POTS Lines for Emergency Calls\n\n\nConfigure a dedicated FXO port for one local PSTN connection for emergency calling:\n\n\ndial-peer voice 10 pots\n destination-pattern 911\n port 1/0/0\n no digit-strip\n exit\n\n!

However, they can still be exploited. \nIf SNMP is necessary\n, \nexploitation of SNMP vulnerabilities can be mitigated by applying interface ACLs to filter SNMP packets from non-authorized systems\n. An exploit may still be possible if the SNMP packet is sourced from an address that has been spoofed and is permitted by the ACL.\n\n\nThese security measures are helpful, but the \nmost effective means of exploitation prevention is to disable the SNMP server on IOS devices for which it is not required\n. As shown in the figure, use the command \nno snmp-server\n to disable SNMP processing on the Cisco IOS devices.\n\n\nno snmp-server",

These security measures are helpful, but the  most effective means of exploitation prevention is to disable the SNMP server on IOS devices for which it is not required .

Configure an IOS IPS Crypto Key\n\n\nLocated in the \nrealm-cisco.pub.key.txt\n file that was obtained in Step 1.\n\n\nThe crypto key verifies the digital signature for the master signature file (\nsigdef-default.xml\n). The content of the file is signed by a Cisco private key to guarantee its authenticity and integrity.\n\n\nOpen the text file to configure the IOS IPS crypto key, as shown in Figure 1. Copy the contents of the file, and paste the contents to the router at the global configuration prompt. The \ntext file issues the various commands to generate the RSA key\n.\n\n\nAt the time of signature compilation, an error message is generated if the public crypto key is invalid.\n\n\nExample Error Message:\n\n\n%IPS-3-INVALID_DIGITAL_SIGNATURE: Invalid Digital Signature found (key not found)\n\n\n\n\nIf the key is configured incorrectly, the key must be removed and then reconfigured.

Identify the IPS rule name and specify the location.\n\n\nCreate a rule name. An optional extended or standard ACL can be configured to filter the scanned traffic.

Traffic that is denied by the ACL is not inspected by the IPS.\n\n\nip ips name \nrule-name\n\nip ips name \nrule-name\n list \nextended or standard acl\n\nip ips config location flash:IPS\n\n\n\n\nNote: Prior to IOS 12.4(11)T, the \nip ips sdf\n location command was used instead of \nip ips config location\n.\n\n\nb. Enable SDEE and logging event notification.\n\n\nTo use SDEE, the HTTP or HTTPS server must first be enabled with the \nip http server\n or \nip https server\n command. If the HTTP server is not enabled, the router cannot respond to the SDEE clients because it cannot see the requests. \n\n\nNote:\n- \nSDEE notification is disabled by default and must be explicitly enabled\n. \n- SDEE and logging can be used independently or enabled at the same time.\n- Logging notification is enabled by default. \n\n\nip http server\nip ips notify ?\nip ips notify sdee  ! Send msgs in SDEE format\nip ips notify log   ! Send msgs in syslog format (default)\n\n\n\n\nc. Configure the signature category.\n\n\nAll signatures are grouped into categories, and the categories are hierarchical. This helps classify signatures for easy grouping and tuning. The three most common categories are \nall\n, \nbasic\n, and \nadvanced\n.\n\n\nWhen IOS IPS is first configured, all signatures in the all category should be retired\n. Then, selected signatures should be unretired in a less memory-intensive category.\n\n\nip ips signature-category\n  category all\n    retired true\n    exit\n  category ios_ips ?\n  category ios_ips basic\n    retired false\n    end\n\n  ! Need to confirm changes\n\n\n\n\nCAUTION:\n- \nDo not unretire the all category\n. The all signature category contains all signatures in a signature release. The IOS IPS cannot compile and use all the signatures at one time because it will run out of memory.\n- The order in which the signature categories are configured on the router is also important.\n\n\nd. Apply the IPS rule to a desired interface, and specify the direction.\n\n\nUse the \nip ips interface configuration\n command to apply the IPS rule, shown in Figure 4.\n\n\nIn the example, the IPS rule IOSIPS is applied to incoming traffic on the G0/0 interface. It is also applied to the incoming and outgoing traffic on the G0/1 interface.\n\n\ninterface g0/0\n  ip ips IOSIPS in\n  exit\ninterface g0/1\n  ip ips IOSIPS in\n  ip ips IOSIPS out\n  end\n\n\n\n\nStep 5. Loading IOS IPS Signature Package to the Router\n\n\nExample:\n\n\ncopy tftp://192.168.1.3/IOS-S415-CLI.pkg idconf\ncopy ftp://ftp_user:password@\nserver-ip-address\n/signaturefile.pkg idconf\n\n\n\n\nTo verify that the signature package is properly compiled:\n\n\nshow ip ips signature count\n\n\n\n\nRetire and Unretire Signatures\n\n\nExample, the signature 6130 with subsig ID of 10 is retired:\n\n\nip ips signature-definition\n  signature 6130 10\n    status\n      retired true\n      exit\n    exit\n  exit\n\n! Prompt: Confirm changes ?\n\n\n\n\nIn this example, all signatures that belong to the IOSIPS Basic category are unretired:\n\n\nip ips signature-category\n  category ios_ips basic\n    retired false\n    exit\n  exit\n\n! Prompt: Confirm changes ?\n\n\n\n\nEnable Signature\n\n\nip ips signature-definition\n  signature \nid\n \nsub-id\n\n    status\n      enabled true\n    exit\n  exit\nexit\n\n\n\n\nChange Signature Actions\n\n\nTo change an action, the \nevent-action\n command must be used in IPS Category Action mode or Signature Definition Engine mode.\n\n\nThe \nevent-action\n command has several parameters:\n\n\nevent-action \naction\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ndeny-attacker-inline\n: Terminates current/future packets from this attacker addr\n\n\ndeny-connection-inline\n: Terminates current/future packets on this TCP flow\n\n\ndeny-packet-inline\n: Terminates the packet\n\n\nproduce-alert\n: Writes event to the Event Store as an alert\n\n\nreset-tcp-connection\n: Sends TCP resets to hijack and terminate TCP flow\n\n\n\n\nExample - Change Actions for Specific Signature:\n\n\nip ips signature-definition\n  signature 6130 10\n    engine\n      event-action produce-alert\n      event-action deny-packet-inline\n      event-action reset-tcp-connection\n      exit\n    exit\n  exit\n\n! Prompt: Confirm changes ?\n\n\n\n\nExample - Change Actions for a Category:\n\n\nip ips signature-category\n  category ios_ips basic\n    event-action produce-alert\n    event-action deny-packet-inline\n    event-action reset-tcp-connection\n    exit\n  exit\n! Prompt: Confirm changes ?\n\n\n\n\nVerify IOS IPS\n\n\nAfter IPS is implemented, it is necessary to verify the configuration to ensure correct operation. There are several \nshow\n commands that can be used to verify the IOS IPS configuration:\n\n\nThe \nshow ip ips\n privileged EXEC command can be used with other parameters to provide specific IPS information.\nThe \nshow ip ips all\n command displays all IPS configuration data, as shown in Figures 1 and 2. The output can be lengthy depending on the IPS configuration.\nThe \nshow ip ips configuration\n command displays additional configuration data that is not displayed with the show running-config command. Figure 3 displays example output of the command.\nThe \nshow ip ips interfaces\n command displays interface configuration data, as shown in Figure 4. The output shows inbound and outbound rules applied to specific interfaces.\nThe \nshow ip ips signatures\n command verifies the signature configuration, as shown in Figure 5. The command can also be used with the keyword detail to provide more explicit output.\nThe \nshow ip ips statistics\n command displays the number of packets audited, and the number of alarms sent, as shown in Figure 6. The optional \nreset\n keyword resets output to reflect the latest statistics.\nUse the \nclear ip ips\n configuration command to disable IPS, remove all IPS configuration entries, and release dynamic resources. The \nclear ip ips statistics\n command resets statistics on packets analyzed, and alarms sent.\n\n\nshow ip ips ?\nshow ip ips all\nshow ip ips configuration\nshow ip ips interfaces\nshow ip ips signatures\nshow ip ips signatures | begin SigID\nshow ip ips statistics\nshow ip ips statistics reset\nclear ip ips\nclear ip ips statistics\n\n\n\n\nReport IPS Alerts\n\n\nTo specify the method of event notification, use the \nip ips notify\n global configuration mode command. The \nlog\n keyword sends messages in syslog format. The \nsdee\n keyword sends messages in SDEE format.\n\n\nThe example in the figure enables syslog reporting.\n\n\nconfig t\n  logging 192.168.10.100\n  ip ips notify log\n  logging on\n\n\n\n\nEnable SDEE\n\n\nSDEE is the preferred method of reporting IPS activity. SDEE uses \nHTTP and XML\n to provide a standardized approach. It can be enabled on an IOS IPS router using the \nip ips notify sdee\n command. The Cisco IOS IPS router can still send IPS alerts via syslog.\n\n\nThe figure shows an example of enabling SDEE reporting.\n\n\nip http server\nip http server-secure\nip ips notify sdee\nip sdee events \nbuffer-size, default:200, max:1000\n\n\n\n\n\nClearing SDEE events/subscriptions:\n\n\nclear ip ips sdee { events | subscriptions }\n\n\n\n\nNote: The\nip ips notify\n command replaces the older \nip audit notify\n command. If the \nip audit notify\n command is part of an existing configuration, the IPS interprets it as the \nip ips notify\n command.",

Copy the contents of the file, and paste the contents to the router at the global configuration prompt. The  text file issues the various commands to generate the RSA key .  At the time of signature compilation, an error message is generated if the public crypto key is invalid.  Example Error Message:  %IPS-3-INVALID_DIGITAL_SIGNATURE: Invalid Digital Signature found (key not found)  If the key is configured incorrectly, the key must be removed and then reconfigured. Use the  no crypto key pubkey-chain rsa  and the no named-key realm-cisco.pub signature  commands. Then repeat the procedure in Step 3 to reconfigure the key.  Step 4. Enable IOS IPS  a. Identify the IPS rule name and specify the location.  Create a rule name. An optional extended or standard ACL can be configured to filter the scanned traffic. All traffic that is permitted by the ACL is subject to inspection by the IPS. Traffic that is denied by the ACL is not inspected by the IPS.  ip ips name  rule-name \nip ips name  rule-name  list  extended or standard acl \nip ips config location flash:IPS  Note: Prior to IOS 12.4(11)T, the  ip ips sdf  location command was used instead of  ip ips config location .  b. Enable SDEE and logging event notification.  To use SDEE, the HTTP or HTTPS server must first be enabled with the  ip http server  or  ip https server  command. If the HTTP server is not enabled, the router cannot respond to the SDEE clients because it cannot see the requests.   Note:\n-  SDEE notification is disabled by default and must be explicitly enabled . \n- SDEE and logging can be used independently or enabled at the same time.\n- Logging notification is enabled by default.   ip http server\nip ips notify ?\nip ips notify sdee  ! Send msgs in SDEE format\nip ips notify log   ! Send msgs in syslog format (default)  c. Configure the signature category.  All signatures are grouped into categories, and the categories are hierarchical. This helps classify signatures for easy grouping and tuning. The three most common categories are  all ,  basic , and  advanced .  When IOS IPS is first configured, all signatures in the all category should be retired . Then, selected signatures should be unretired in a less memory-intensive category.  ip ips signature-category\n  category all\n    retired true\n    exit\n  category ios_ips ?\n  category ios_ips basic\n    retired false\n    end\n\n  ! Need to confirm changes  CAUTION:\n-  Do not unretire the all category . The all signature category contains all signatures in a signature release. The IOS IPS cannot compile and use all the signatures at one time because it will run out of memory.\n- The order in which the signature categories are configured on the router is also important.  d. Apply the IPS rule to a desired interface, and specify the direction.  Use the  ip ips interface configuration  command to apply the IPS rule, shown in Figure 4.  In the example, the IPS rule IOSIPS is applied to incoming traffic on the G0/0 interface. It is also applied to the incoming and outgoing traffic on the G0/1 interface.  interface g0/0\n  ip ips IOSIPS in\n  exit\ninterface g0/1\n  ip ips IOSIPS in\n  ip ips IOSIPS out\n  end  Step 5. Loading IOS IPS Signature Package to the Router  Example:  copy tftp://192.168.1.3/IOS-S415-CLI.pkg idconf\ncopy ftp://ftp_user:password@ server-ip-address /signaturefile.pkg idconf  To verify that the signature package is properly compiled:  show ip ips signature count",
