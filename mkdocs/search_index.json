The local route has a /128 prefix. Local routes are used by the routing table to efficiently process packets with the interface address of the router as the destination.\n\n\nThe \nping\n command for IPv6 is identical to the command used with IPv4 except that an IPv6 address is used.

IPv4 static routes are configured using the following command:\n\n\nip route \nnetwork-address\n \nsubnet-mask\n { next-hop-ip | exit-intf }\n\n\n\n\nA static route is identified in the routing table with the code \u2018S\u2019.\n\n\nA \ndefault static route\n is similar to a default gateway on a host. The default static route specifies the exit point to use when the routing table does not contain a path for the destination network. A default static route is useful when a router has only one exit point to another router, such as when the router connects to a central router or service provider.\n\n\nTo configure an IPv4 default static route, use the following command:\n\n\nRouter(config)# ip route 0.0.0.0 0.0.0.0 { exit-intf | next-hop-ip }\n\n\n\n\nIP Route Command\n\n\nRequires following parameters:\n\n\n\n\nNetwork-address (destination); often referred to as the \nprefix\n\n\nSubnet-mask (or just mask); can be modified to summarize a group of networks.\n\n\n\n\nAlso one or both of the following:\n\n\n\n\nIP-address of the connecting router to use for forwarding; commonly referred to as the \nnext hop\n.\n\n\nExit-intf: the outgoing interface to use to forward the packet to the next hop.\n\n\n\n\nThe distance parameter is used to create a floating static route by setting an administrative distance that is higher than a dynamically learned route.\n\n\nip route \nnetwork-address\n \nsubnet-mask\n {ip-address | exit-intf}\n\n\n\n\nNext Hop Options\n\n\nThe next hop can be identified by an IP address, exit interface, or both. How the destination is specified creates one of the three following route types:\n\n\n\n\nNext-hop route - Only the next-hop IP address is specified\n\n\nDirectly connected static route - Only the router exit interface is specified\n\n\nFully specified static route - The next-hop IP address and exit interface are specified\n\n\n\n\nshow ip route | begin Gateway\nshow ip route | include C\n\n\n\n\nConfigure an IPv4 Floating Static Route\n\n\n\n\nGiven an example where R1 is attached to R2 (172.16.2.2) and R3 (10.10.10.2), the following would create a default static route to R2, and a floating static route to R3:\n\n\n\n\nip route 0.0.0.0 0.0.0.0 172.16.2.2     # Default route to R2\nip route 0.0.0.0 0.0.0.0 10.10.10.2 5   # Floating default route to R3\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDefault route to R2 has no administrative distance specified, so would default to 1. This is the preferred route..\n\n\nFloating default route to R3 has administrative distance 5. Since this value is greater that of the default route, this route \"floats\" - it is not present in the routing table unless the preferred route fails.\n\n\n\n\nDefault Administrative Distances\n\n\nConnected                   0\nStatic                      1\nEIGRP summary route         5\nExternal BGP                20\nInternal EIGRP              90\nIGRP                        100\nOSPF                        110\nIS-IS                       115\nRIP                         120\nExternal EIGRP              170\nInternal BGP                200\n\n\n\n\nVerify a Static Route\n\n\nshow ip route\nshow ip route static                  # Displays contents of static routes\nshow ip route static | begin Gateway\nshow ip route \nnetwork\n\n\nshow running-config | section ip route\ntraceroute \nip-address\n\n\n\n\n\nIPv6 Routes\n\n\nStatic routes for IPv6 are configured using the ipv6 route global configuration command.\n\n\nipv6 route \nipv6-prefix/prefixlength\n {ipv6-address | exit-intf}\n\n\n\n\nDisplaying and Testing IPv6 Routes\n\n\nshow ipv6 route\nshow ipv6 route static\nshow ipv6 route \nnetwork\n\nshow running-config | section ipv6 route\n\nping ipv6 \nipv6-address\n\ntraceroute \n\n\n\n\n\nConfigure a Directly Connected Static IPv6 Route\n\n\nipv6 route \nipv6-address\n/\nnetwork-prefix\n \ninterface\n\nipv6 route 2001:db8:acad:2::/64 s0/0/0\n\n\n\n\nConfigure a Fully Specified Static IPv6 Route\n\n\nipv6 route \nipv6-address\n/\nnetwork-prefix\n \ninterface\n \nnext-hop ipv6-address\n\nipv6 route 2001:db8:acad:2::/64 s0/0/0 fe80::2\n\n\n\n\nConfigure a Default IPv6 Static Route\n\n\nipv6 route ::/0 {ipv6-address | exit-intf}\nipv6 route ::/ 2001:db8:acad:4::2\n\n\n\n\nConfigure an IPv6 Floating Static Route\n\n\nipv6 route ::/0 \nipv6-address\n \nadministrative-distance\n\nipv6 route ::/0 2001:db8:aad:4::2\nipv6 route ::/0 2001:db8:aad:6::2 5\n\n\n\n\nCommon IOS Troubleshooting Commands\n\n\nping\nping \nip-address\n source \nsource_ip\n\ntraceroute \nip-address\n\nshow ip route | begin Gateway\nshow ip interface brief\nshow cdp neighbors detail\n\n\n\n\nConfiguring Dynamic Routing\n\n\nAccess RIP configuration mode\n\n\nrouter rip\nno router rip\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrompt will show up as \nRouter(config-router)#\n\n\nWhen enabling RIP, the default version is RIPv1.\n\n\nTo disable and eliminate RIP, use the \nno router rip\n global configuration command.

However, even though the router only sends RIPv1 messages, it can interpret both RIPv1 and RIPv2 messages. A \nRIPv1 router ignores the RIPv2 fields in the route entry\n.\n\n\nUse the \nversion 2\n router configuration mode command to enable RIPv2, as shown in Figure 2. Notice how the \nshow ip protocols\n command verifies that R2 is now configured to send and receive version 2 messages only. The RIP process now includes the subnet mask in all updates, making \nRIPv2 a classless routing protocol\n.\n\n\nNote: Configuring \nversion 1\n enables RIPv1 only, while configuring \nno version\n returns the router to the default setting of sending version 1 updates but listening for version 1 and version 2 updates.\n\n\nDisable Auto Summarization\n\n\nno auto-summary\n\n\n\n\nPropogate a Default Route\n\n\nTo propagate a default route in RIP, the edge router must be configured with:\n\n\n\n\nA default static route using the \nip route 0.0.0.0 0.0.0.0\n command.\n\n\nThe \ndefault-information originate\n router configuration command.

Use the  version 2  router configuration mode command to enable RIPv2, as shown in Figure 2.

The RIP process now includes the subnet mask in all updates, making  RIPv2 a classless routing protocol .
